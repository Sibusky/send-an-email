# Send an email

Let's imagine a scenario. There's a form on the website. We want the user to fill out the fields, press the "Submit" button, and the data to be sent directly to the website owner's email.

This is a Node.js server that allows fetching data from a website form (name, email, phone, message) and sending it to the website owner's email. This can be used where a user submits a request for services or provides feedback on using the service.
